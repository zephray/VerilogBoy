VerilogBoy
==========

Coding for fun - the hard way. Trying to implement a Game Boy® compatible machine with Verilog.

This project is an open source Game Boy® compatible console Verilog RTL implementation.

# System Architecture

The main system architecture is designed as follows (outdated):

![Architecture](https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6958041523363605244.jpg)

There are three major parts needs to be implemented: the Game Boy CPU (8-bit CISC Processor called SM83, Intel 8080 like), the PPU (Pixel Processing Unit), and the sound unit (sometimes referred as a PSG, Programmable Sound Generator). Several interfacing modules are needed to support the IO capability provided by the hardware (such as an FPGA development board).

# Targets (Ports)

Current Pano Logic G1 is the only supported platform.

# Progress

Refactoring in progress. Current version could run several commerical games with no noticable glitch on the Pano Logic G1 device. 'Master' branch contains the previous version that runs on the ML505.

 - [x] SM83 CPU (Refactoring stage 1 done, passes all Blargg's tests)
 - [x] PPU (Pixel Processing Unit, Pixel-FIFO architecture)
 - [x] OAMDMA (Object Attribute Memory DMA)
 - [x] PSG (Programmable Sound Generator)
 - [x] Timer
 - [x] Link (Dummy link module, allows some games to run in single player mode)

Next step would be improving the accuracy.

# Accuracy

This project is not built to be entirely accurate, but built with accuracy in mind. Most of the CPU timing should follow the original DMG-CPU, and implement a rudimentary 2-stage pipelining just as the original one does. 

Here are the results of several tests I have tried to run on it.

PPU implementation is ... wrong: There are two pipelines in the GameBoy PPU, one for BG and one for sprite. I only implemented one for both. There is only one fetcher, though.

Note: Tests which depends on the revision / model of GameBoy are omitted. VerilogBoy only focus on behaviors that are common among all monochrome GameBoys (GS).

# How to use

## Verilator-based simulator

Tested environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, mac OS Big Sur. 

Dependencies: build-essential, verilator, libsdl2-dev, wine(optional, for unit test only, for now), rgbds(not available from apt, need build manually).

On Debian/ Ubuntu, do the following:

```
sudo apt install build-essential verilator libsdl2-dev wine byacc flex pkg-config libpng-dev
```

On macOS, do the following:

```
brew install verilator sdl2 pkg-config libpng
```

cd rgbds
make
make install
```

### Build

At project directory:
```
make
```

Copy the bootrom.mif to where it is required. (For example, target/panog1)

### Running unit-tests

At project directory:
```
cd roms/tests
make
./compare.sh
```

### Running ROMs

At project directory:
```
./sim/verilator/vb_sim <path_to_your_rom.gb> --mbc --nostop
```

Few parameters:
```
--nostop: Don't stop execution at halt/stop (but stop at illegal instructions)
--trace: Generate vcd waveform trace
--testmode: Disable internal Boot ROM, headless mode, limit cycles to 32K.
--noboot: Disable internal Boot ROM, code execution starts at 0x0000 rather than 0x0100.
--verbose: Enable debug output
--mbc: Enable MBC1/3/5 emulation for ROMs larger than 32KB
```
